# -Metaheuristic-Solutions-for-the-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-
Implemented metaheuristic solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) utilizing various optimization algorithms, including the Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Each algorithm was applied to determine the most efficient route for a salesman to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city. The Nearest Neighbor algorithm constructs a solution by iteratively selecting the nearest unvisited city to the current city. The Genetic Algorithm employs evolutionary principles such as mutation, crossover, and selection to iteratively improve candidate solutions. Ant Colony Optimization mimics the foraging behavior of ants to iteratively build and refine routes based on pheromone trails. This project demonstrates proficiency in metaheuristic algorithm implementation and optimization techniques, contributing to advancements in route optimization and logistics.
